By default, the `.head()` and `.tail()` functions show the first/last five rows of the dataset. The number of rows shown can be altered by setting the number inside the function parentheses. However, if the number of rows requested is excessive, then the dataframe will only show several rows from the top of the dataframe, skip the middle section, and then show the last few rows.

    "When looking for duplicates in `pandas`, the `.duplicated()` function by default searches for duplication across an entire row (meaning, all the values in one row are exactly the same as all the values in another row). It produces a column of boolean values (`True`/`False`) indicated if the row is a duplicate. The first time the `.duplicated()` function sees a row of information, it is not considered as duplicate (because it has not seen any other similar rows of data). However, whenever the function comes across the same information again, then that row (and any following rows that contain the same data) are then marked as duplicates. To look for duplicates only for specific columns, then use the argument `.duplicated(subset=[list of column names])`. "

    "Dataframe rows and columns can be referred to in two different ways - either by their label or by their index position. Column labels are the header names and are typically purposely named in the dataset. User-defined row labels are less common; if there are not any specific labels given to the rows, then the index position also becomes the label (same goes for column labels). Because Python positions start from zero, the first column or row is always index position zero, no matter what labels are assigned to the row.\n",

If the original dataframe had default labels (using position) assigned to the rows (and columns, if applicable) then the subset labels will be inherited from the original dataframe, even though the index positions are different. For example, if a row had a label `4` and was also in index position `4`, then was assigned to a subset where it is now the first row, then the label would still be `4` but the position is `0`. \n",
